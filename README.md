This repository is for 'ramt.in' website development currenty on WAMP before going online.
Much has to be done before the website would be ready to go online, including:

  * Working out an SQL/PHP database system to show the contents of the website.
  * Finishing the design of website.
  * Making every page work with the system.
  * Finishing the website.
  * Creating a personal Windows-based CMS (Content Management System) in C# to manage the databases.
